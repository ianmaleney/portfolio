			<p>I'm an experienced web developer with a history of creating beautiful, accessible websites in modern PHP and Javascript.</p>
			<p>I've worked with a number of small businesses, arts organisations, and cultural institutions, including The Stinging Fly, Paper Visual Art, Tramp Press, and the Royal Society of Antiquarians.</p>
			<p>I am available for freelance and contract work in this area. I'm particularly interested in working with media companies, newspapers, magazines, and cultural institutions. I enjoy optimising and improving an older site just as much as designing and launching a new one. Send me an email if you'd like to work with me.</p>
